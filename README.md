I only added a few myself*


*These are 900+ custom folder icons for Windows 11 in .ICO format.*


# How to install:

**1.** Download the .zip attachment and extract its contents to a permanent location you can find later.

**2.** Locate your user folder by navigating to C:\Users\[YOUR-USERNAME]\.

**3** Either find the folder that you'd like to customize or create a new folder.

**4.** Right click the target folder and select "Properties."

**5.** Under the "Customize" tab, select "Change Icon...".

**6.** Navigate to your custom .ico file and select it, and click Apply.

**Note: it's recommended to find a permanent place to store your custom .ico files so they don't get moved. For example I made a folder in System32 with the name "icons".**
